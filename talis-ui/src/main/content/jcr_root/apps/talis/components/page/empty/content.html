      <p>This &lt;talis-topic-preview&gt; element was added directly into the page component. The "empty page" aem component uses the "Topic Preview" design pattern without needing to know the markup of that design pattern. The implementation details are hidden and it can add in it's own markup independently of the Featured Story.</p>
